## Scripts

`getFlakyTests.py`

- Retrieves all functions in a project
- Retrieves all tests in a project (name starts with `test_`)
- Retrieves all flaky tests among tests
    - Works for annotated tests when class is annotated
    - Works for annotated FunctionDef, AsyncFunctionDef
- Retrieves body for all functions and tests
- Adds X most similar functions to each test
- Saves all elements in a JSON file

`parseXml.py` 
- Summarizes results of flaky reports generated with pytest.

[WIP] `buildDataset.py`
- Attempt to build dataset based on flaky tests from the reruns and pytest list. 

`model.py` 
- Takes JSON generated by `getFlakyTests.py` as input
- Trains on flaky non flaky
- Tries to predict flakiness of test set 

`insightsBoW.py` 
- Takes JSON generated by `getFlakyTests.py` as input
- Tokenizes tests
- Gives insights about Bag of Words 

`randomExperiment.py`
The goal is to see if Bag of Words representation gives same results when test are not labelled regarding flakiness.
- Takes JSON generated by `getFlakyTests.py` as input
- Randomly reaffect new random value for Label
- Save to JSON, later to be tested by model.py

`testModelOnManifest.py`
Train model and test in on manifest flaky tests

`trainDatasetBalanced.py`
Check results when balancing the dataset


## Classes

`functionObject.py` represents a function

`analyzer.py` handle the AST analysis

## Folders

`manifest` contains files with manifest Flaky Tests obtained from reruns

`results` contains datasets for each project
